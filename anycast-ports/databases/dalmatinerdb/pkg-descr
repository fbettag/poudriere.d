DalmatinerDB is a no fluff purpose built metric database.
Not a layer put on top of a general purpose database or datastore.
This allows features that otherwise wouldn't be possible:
- a highly optimized network protocol
- sequential reads/writes for metrics
- and a client-server model that takes as much load from the actual store as possible
DalmatinerDB is built to take advantage of its features such as integrity, ARC, compression, and ZIL.
